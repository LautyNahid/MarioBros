## Challenges & Applied Concepts
During the development of this project, several software development principles and practices were applied to ensure maintainability, scalability, and a clean codebase:
- **Clean Code**: Emphasis on readable, organized, and easily maintainable code.
- **Design Patterns**: Utilization of patterns like Factory, State, Etc.
- **Refactoring**: Continuous improvement of the code to enhance efficiency and clarity.
- **SOLID Principles**: Ensured adherence to object-oriented design principles for better modularity and reduced coupling.

## Technologies Used
- **Java**: Core language for the game.
- **Swing and AWT**: For graphics rendering and game window management.
- **Multithreading**: Ensures smooth movement and continuous game updates.
